LegitApply is a Python based program that is being used to automate the job search process on LinkedIn. The program
itself will scrap job listings, filter out promoted and potentially ghost jobs and verify that each job is found on the
company's official career page. Customizable filters such as job type, location and verification status will be present.
As of now the plan is to have a command-line interface and potentially down the line creating a web-based interface
to help search and organize applications.
